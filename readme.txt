sleekStore - instant way to start sales and launch online store powered by WordPress. Functional, convenient, hyper-flexlible.  

== Description ==

= What is sleekStore? =

SleekStore is a plugin that extends WordPress with online store functionality .
 
Functionality of the plug-in is based on the assumption that certain posts 
or pages are treated as products. Description of a product is defined 
by the content of the post with an added parameter “Price”. 
By default, “Add to cart” button is displayed on each page/post with defined price.
 
sleekStore allows for adding products to the cart and handles order procedure. 
The display and presentation of the products is not enforced in any way 
and the user decide whether products are defined as subpages or e.g. posts of a specific category.
 
This solution is very flexible and does not require any additional skills beyond the basic wordpress editing.
 
In addition, sleekStore contains configuration panel, panel to handle orders, shortcodes and other elements 
to improve the process and order management.
